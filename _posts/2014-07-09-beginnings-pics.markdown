The first UI element created was the Knob.

For months, the app was mostly knobs, initially without labels.

The intent wasnâ€™t to use the knob in the final app, but it gave us a way to test the synth parameters.

In fact our rough metric for progress was: How many parameters are still knobs?

By the time we began adding other UI elements the synth was mostly done.
