Seaquence is a music making app that enables you to create soundscapes with collections of swimming musical creatures. A spatialized mix emerges as only the closest voices can be heard, resulting in a organic sonic experience that changes as you play. Visually immersive and sonically dynamic, Seaquence is a unique and fun audiovisual environment.

Featuring a pro-level synthesizer and timing engine controlled by a fun and direct interface. Even composers who are brand new to synthesis will be able to unlock their synesthetic creativity.

Edit your sounds with multi-touch controls including a polyphonic sequencer, chromatic scale w/octave, amplitude envelope editor, multiple waveform types, and more. With a single in-app purchase ({{ site.app.price }}), all extended features of the app unlock and include delay fx and fx send, filters (hipass, bandpass, lopass, and notch) and filter attack envelope, additional voice modes, extra sequencer controls, transpose, MIDI + Clock Sync, and more!
