Seaquence is a unique musical sequencer app that allows you to create soundscapes by layering collections of swimming musical creatures. A spatialized mix emerges as only the closest creatures can be heard, resulting in a organic sonic experience that changes as you play. Visually immersive and sonically dynamic, Seaquence is a completely unique audiovisual composition environment.

Seaquence features a pro-level synthesizer and timing engine controlled by a fun and direct interface. Even composers who are brand new to synthesis will be able to unlock their synesthetic creativity.

Seaquence includes multi-touch editing tools such as a 16x16 polyphonic sequencer, a scale editor w/octave, envelope editor, and multiple oscillator types. With a single in-app purchase, pro-level features are unlocked which include Delay FX, State-Variable Filter, MIDI + Clock Sync, and more.
