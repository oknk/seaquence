Seaquence is an app for iOS that enables you to compose music with collections of synthsizer creatures. Only the voices in view can be heard, resulting in organic and dynamic soundscapes as you explore and create your mix. The creatures body and tail are generated from the parameters of its synth and sequencer, which in turn modify its swimming patterns.  Visually immersive and sonically dynamic, Seaquence is a unique and fun audiovisual environment.

Featuring a pro-level synthesizer and timing engine controlled by a fun and direct interface. Even composers who are brand new to synthesis will be able to unlock their synesthetic creativity. For more experienced users, Seaquence features MIDI support and clock sync, allowing the app to integrate with other gear.
