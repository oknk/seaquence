Seaquence is an app for iOS that enables you to compose music with collections of synthsizer creatures. Only the voices in view can be heard, resulting in organic and dynamic soundscapes as you explore and create your mix. The creatures body and tail are generated from the parameters of its synth and sequencer, which in turn modify its swimming patterns.  Visually immersive and sonically dynamic, Seaquence is a unique and fun audiovisual environment.
