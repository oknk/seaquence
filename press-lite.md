## What is Seaquence?

Seaquence is a music making app that enables you to create soundscapes with collections of swimming musical creatures. A spatialized mix emerges as only the closest creatures can be heard, resulting in a organic sonic experience that changes as you play. Creatures can be added or removed from the mix, moved around, and swim on their own resulting in an organic composition. Visually immersive and sonically dynamic, Seaquence is a unique and fun audiovisual environment.

Edit your sounds with multi-touch controls including a polyphonic sequencer, chromatic scale w/octave, amplitude envelope editor, multiple waveform types, and more. With a single in-app purchase ({{ site.app.price }}), all extended features of the app unlocked  and include tape delay fx and fx send, filters (hipass, bandpass, lopass, and notch) and filter attack envelope, additional voice modes, extra sequencer controls, transpose, MIDI + Clock Sync, and more.


## What makes Seaquence unique?

Seaquence features a pro-level synthesizer and timing engine controlled by a fun and direct interface playfully visualized as swimming creatures. Even composers who are brand new to synthesis will be able to unlock their synesthetic creativity. The musical compositions made with Seaquence are visually fun to play with and fun listen to.


## How did Seaquence come into existence?

## Seaquence's Design Idology

The interface design philosophy is based on a bright and colorful mostly textless interface, encouraging exploration and playful interaction between audio and visual. A custom physics engine was developed which allows the creatures swimming motions to feel smooth, and organic and playful. Each creature has a unique swimming movement that is derived from the notes in their individual sequencer tempo and pattern, represented by pulsing nodes in their antennae, and their tail is a graphical representation of their waveform.

Seaquence was created with [Cinder](http://libcinder.org) and uses [PureData](http://puredata.info/) as its sound engine.
