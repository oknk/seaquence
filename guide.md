# Guide

To get the most out of Seaquence, we've created this user guide that goes over its features ranging from basics to some hidden tricks. It's a continous work in progress as we make updates to the app.

Feel free to [contact](/seaquence/contact) us with more questions.

# Quick Guide

When you first start the app, you're greeted with a demo session and an info overlay.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/screenshots/screenshot_iPad9.7_2x_00033.png)

After tapping "OKAY!", in this view you can drag creatures around, and drag your view around. Notice how the stereo panning changes as you move creatures and the view. Only the closest creatures are heard.

You can start and stop the synth from playing at any time by tapping the play/pause button at the top of the screen.

## Delete Creatures

PRESS & HOLD to delete creatures.

## Add new Creature

By tapping the green Add Creature button on the top left, a new creature will be created. If you tap this with the voice editor open, a clone of the current creature will be created.

## Edit a Creature

Back in the composition, when you tap a creature, its voice editor opens. There are 4 tabs:

### 1. Scale

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/screenshots/screenshot_iPad12.9_2x_00053_thumb.png)

Here you can select which notes of the 12-note chromatic scale the sequencer uses, and below it you can change the octave.

### 2. Sequencer

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/screenshots/screenshot_iPad12.9_2x_00029_thumb.png)

The main "DNA" of the creature â€“ a 16x16 matrix sequencer. Below the sequencer from left to right are step timing, shuffle, glide, and voice mode.

### 3. Envelopes

Here, you can select which waveform the creature uses, and adjust the amplitude envelope and note length.

The first set of five colored icons are the Oscillator type -- Square (Green), Saw (Red), Sin (Blue), Tri (Yellow), and Noise (Pink).

Below that is the ADSR-L control, which effects the amplitude of each tone played in the sequencer. The long slider underneath the ADSR is "L", standing for "length", which controls how long each note is held down, as if it were a key on a piano.

Below that is the Filter envelope. The left handle is the filter attack time and cutoff frequency, the second handle is the destination cutoff and frequency, and the far right handle toggles through the filter types: Low Pass, High Pass, Band Pass, and Notch.

### 4. Global Controls

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/screenshots/screenshot_iPad9.7_0.5x_00000.png)

These are global controls for the entire composition. Here you can edit the tempo and master volume. The first knob on the top left is Transpose, which changes the overall tone of the session. Then there is a Master Volume slider , and a BPM knob which controls the over all tempo of the composition.

Below is the Delay effect. I you've entered the global controls after selecting a creature, you will see the creatures FX send which controls the amount its voice will be affected by the delay effect. If you enter this panel directly, this control will be hidden.

The delay effect has two areas of interaction -- by dragging on the delay bars directly, and the quantized area below. When dragging on the delay area left to right, you will change the delay timing freely. When dragging on the gray quantized area below, it will change the delay timing quantized to 1/4 and 1/3 timings relative to the Tempo/BPM.

Note: You can access this panel directly from the Sea.

To exit any editor, tap on the "Sea" area or tap the close editor icon on the top left.

## Save + Share + Explore

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/screenshots/screenshot_iPad12.9_2x_00066_thumb.png)

In this area, you can save your session by tapping green "Save Session" button on the right of the editor. It will prompt you for a Name and Creator for the session, and will save on your device. To share, tap the Cloud icon on the sessions thumbnail and it will return a sharable link.

Tap the Galaxy icon in the top center of the editor to browse all publically shared Seaquence links. If you are inspired by anything you find, you can download them and modify, change, remix, and make them your own.

To start a new session from scratch, tap the icon on the top right of the screen to clear.
