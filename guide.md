# Guide

Thank you for using Seaquence! This app is made with love, and designed to be used and enjoyed, hopefully giving you hours of creative and sonic experiences.

To get the most out of Seaquence, we've created this user guide. There's a [quick](#quick) version and a [full](#full) version.

Check out the community forum at _____ (?)

# Quick Guide

When you first start the App, you are greeted with the Session Browser. Try exploring some of the preset session that ship with the app to get an idea of the kinds of sounds you'll be able to make. You can also delete the playing session and start a new one.

## Edit a Session

By tapping on the playing Seaquence session, you'll enter into the "Sea". Here, you can drag creatures around, and drag your view around. Notice how the stereo panning changes as you move around, and only the closest creatures are heard.

## Edit a Creature

By tapping on a Creature, its voice editor opens. There are 4 tabs.

### 1. Scale

Here you can select which notes of the 12-note chromatic scale the sequencer uses. You can also change the octave.

### 2. Sequencer

The main "DNA" of the creature. This is the note sequencer page, as well as note-step.

### 3. Envelopes

Here, you can select which waveform the creature uses, and adjust the amplitude envelope and note length.

### 4. Master Channel

These are global controls for the entire composition. Here you can edit the tempo and master volume.

## Create a new Creature

By tapping the green Add Creature button on the top left, a new creature will be created. If you tap this with the voice editor open, a clone of the current creature will be created.

## Delete a Creature

In the Sea, long-press on any creature and you'll be able to tap a creatures' delete icon to remove it. Tap in the Sea when you're done.

## Save your Creation

When you like what you've created, tap on the Session Browser icon on the bottom left, and save a new snapshot of your creation. Share the link with your friends!
