A long, long time ago in the spring of 2009, [Ryan Alexander](http://onecm.com), [Gabriel Dunne](http://gabrieldunne.com), and [Daniel Massey](http://daniel-massey.com) participated in fledgling arts organization [Gray Area](http://grayarea.org)’s first artist residency in the Tenderloin, the heart of San Francisco. While there, they created the original [seaquence.org](http://seaquence.org) web app with support from the community at Gray Area. Originally written in Adobe Flash, Seaquence became a seminal project that blossomed into a vibrant community and has accumulated well over 300,000 compositions. It continues to be enjoyed by people around the world.

Since then a lot has changed. Flash has slowly been phased out as an interactive platform on the web, and doesn't work on mobile devices.

In 2014 Ryan and Gabe decided that the best way to keep the Seaquence community alive was to do what they had been talking about for years — bring the app to touchscreens. Over the next two and a half years, they built a new version of Seaquence from the ground up. It featured a brand-new codebase with shiny new graphics and integrated a high quality sound engine, evolving Seaquence from a Flash web-toy to a fully-featured musical platform and instrument.
