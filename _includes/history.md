A long, long time ago in the spring of 2009, three friends Ryan Alexander, Gabriel Dunne, and Daniel Massey participated in fledgling arts organization [Gray Area](http://grayarea.org)’s first artist residency in the Tenderloin, the heart of San Francisco. While there, they created the original [seaquence.org](http://seaquence.org) web app with support from the community at Gray Area. Originally written in Adobe Flash, Seaquence became a seminal project that blossomed into a vibrant community and has accumulated well over 300,000 compositions. It continues to be enjoyed by people around the world.

Seaquence spanned into physical installation as well. A hardware 'SeaNome' RGB button grid was created as a hardware controller and used in physical installations.

Since then a lot has changed. Flash has slowly been phased out as an interactive platform on the web, and doesn't work on mobile devices.

In mid-2014 Ryan and Gabe decided that the best way to keep the Seaquence community alive was to do what they had been talking about for years — bring the app to iOS. Over the next two and a half years, they built a new version of Seaquence from the ground up with a brand-new codebase, introducing shiny new graphics and a high quality sound engine, graduating Seaquence from a Flash web-toy to a fully-featured musical experience.
